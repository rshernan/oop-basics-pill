* Understand Herency.
* Understand how to use Abstraction.
* Understand what is Polymorphism.
* Understand what interfaces are and what they are used for.

## Theoretical part
Investigate the paradigm of object-oriented programming in general terms. This research aims to clarify the following concepts:

- ### What is object-oriented programming in general terms?

Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. There are many object-oriented programming languages including JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python.

- ### What is a class?

A class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

- ### What is an object?

In the object-oriented programming paradigm object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures; in particular in class-based variation of the paradigm it refers to a particular instance of a class.

- ### What is an instance?

An instance is a concrete occurrence of any object, existing usually during the runtime of a computer program. Formally, "instance" is synonymous with "object" as they are each a particular value (realization), and these may be called an instance object; "instance" emphasizes the distinct identity of the object. The creation of an instance is called instantiation.

- ### What is a property?

A property, in some object-oriented programming languages, is a special sort of class member, intermediate in functionality between a field (or data member) and a method.

- ### What is a method?

A method in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with a message and an object. An object consists of data and behavior; these comprise an interface, which specifies how the object may be utilized by any of its various consumers.

- ### What is the difference between a function and a method?

A method, like a function, is a set of instructions that perform a task. The difference is that a method is associated with an object, while a function is not.

- ### What is a constructor?

A constructor is a method that is called at the beginning of an object's lifetime to create and initialize the object, a process called construction (or instantiation). Initialization may include an acquisition of resources. Constructors may have parameters but usually do not return values in most languages.

- ### What is the difference between a class, an object and an instance?

A class is a blueprint which you use to create objects. An object is an instance of a class - it's a concrete 'thing' that you made using a specific class. So, 'object' and 'instance' are the same thing, but the word 'instance' indicates the relationship of an object to its class.

- ### What do we understand by the concept of encapsulation?

Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing direct access to them by clients in a way that could expose hidden implementation details or violate state invariance maintained by the methods.

- ### What do we understand by the concept of abstraction?

In object-oriented programming theory, abstraction involves the facility to define objects that represent abstract “actors” that can perform work, report on and change their state, and “communicate” with other objects in the system.

- ### What do we understand by the concept of inheritance?

Inheritance is the procedure in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class. The class whose properties and methods are inherited is known as the Parent class. And the class that inherits the properties from the parent class is the Child class.

- ### What do we understand by the concept of polymorphism?

Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to respond in a unique way to the same message.

- ### What do we understand by the concept of Overload?

Overloading is the reuse of the same symbol or function name for two or more distinct operations or functions. Whilst this may sound confusing, used carefully it helps to keep code transparent. Overloading can be used with operators and functions.

- ### What do we understand by the concept of Override?

Overriding a method simply means that a subclass redefines its inherited method(s) when it needs to change or extend the behavior of that method.

- ### What differences exist between the concept of Overload and Override?

Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters. Overriding occurs when two methods have the same method name and parameters. One of the methods is in the parent class, and the other is in the child class.

- ### What is a static class?

A static class cannot be instantiated. In other words, you cannot use the new operator to create a variable of the class type.

- ### Look for 3 advantages over object-oriented programming compared to other programming paradigms

    - Improved productivity.
    - High abstraction level.
    - Rich encapsulation.

- ### Look for disadvantages of this paradigm.

    - Steep learning curve: may take time to get used to it
    - Larger program size
    - Slower programs
